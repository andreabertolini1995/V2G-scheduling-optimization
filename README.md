Profit optimisation of a Vehicle-to-Grid energy aggregator participating in the ancillary services and energy market formulated as a Convex Linear Problem using the Pyomo modeling language.  

This study is inspired by the paper *Optimal Scheduling of Vehicle-to-Grid Energy and Ancillary Services* (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6021358), which however differs from it on two aspects:
* a comparison between traditional Smart Charging and more innovative Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) is proposed,
* the Italian electricity market and regulations are considered.
